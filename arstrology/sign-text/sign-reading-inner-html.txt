You can be instinctually skillful in slowly finding an ideal equipoise with your art career . Regardless , you need to be spontaneously attending an MFA program , ideally one from <em>Yale</em> .
<|Pparse|>
Refrain from staying in control of artmaking , or the history of your artmaking if you must . Let go of ideas that aren't really ideas , and don't have any concrete existence besides the most superficial . Like the whole "physical world" concept---<em>physical , emotional , and sensual</em> . Don't get it wrong , an intellectually stimulating environment full of new ideas is lovable . But if you have to choose between living with unsolicited meanings that keep cropping up and living without them , then choose the latter with all your heart . 
<|Pparse|>
You don't want people to know that you’re feeling relaxed and comfortable with yourself and that you’re not judging people who are going through the same thing . Maybe you can’t seem to decide whether or not you’re comfortable with yourself and what you’re doing .

This is a great time to be an artist .
<br>Don't overspend , only get what you need .
<br>If you were going to do some sports in this period , do it outside and wear monochrome sweats .
<|Pparse|>
You are looking for the ideal utopia of your own making , and you can be that idealizer in any given situation . Look at your art career through rose-colored glasses . It all depends on how you see your role . Color coding your career can be confusing . For example , if you were formerly a scientist , and are now a sculptor , or perhaps you were trained to be a social worker and are now a mediator between business and film-making , merge your roles in a romantic way .
<|Pparse|>
It is extremely important that you are personally popular and valued for your contributions to the <em>Art World</em> . Then it is very important that you are valued for your own sake . In terms of personal style , you need to choose carefully between a desire to remain relatively childlike and an urgency to try going beyond childlike , so to include others in your artistic fantasies .
<|Pparse|>
You have an insight into the causes of failure and can make informed financial and investment decisions .

Sneaking into an uninvited show , with disguised enthusiasm , love of gadgetry , red outfits , and all the latest trends in life . You are very creative at getting others excited about what you have in mind and presenting your own unique spin on things . 
<|Pparse|>
Very sociable . You may not always think things over or through in a given situation . People can sometimes be annoyingly uncomprehending but it is nice to have your own back and be able to offer a different perspective than the typical "everyone else is wrong" perspective . Sometimes that is necessary if you want your ideas to be taken seriously while you also want to be known as being different .
<|Pparse|>
Actively performing---feelings put on display---is where you shine . Your performance may be affected by the audience , as well as the way you appear via a public veneer of your personality . Your performance can be highly individualized depending on the specific event you are attending . 
<|Pparse|>
Always on the move , you love all that technology offers .
<br>Carefully considered words , a well-constructed narrative , a well-constructed context . . .these make up your persona . 
<br>During this period , you definitely should not get your hair cut or colored .
<|Pparse|>
Here , you will fight to be active , engaging , and fun-giving . And fight to communicate and interact with others more often than not . You were on the far side of the show . The shift from the farther to the center of your attention will come across as emotional , strongly emotional , and confident .
<|Pparse|>
You are definitely not calm .
<br>Your avatar is driven by the core of your ongoing realization of quick project ideas .
<br>You are both a creative and a project manager .
<|Pparse|>
You may be tempted to shy away from difficult topics , in order to maintain a facade of composure . That is okay but you will need to find which high horse you are on and get to know your audience . As others get to know you , they will learn that you are genuinely curious and easily flabbergasted by unfamiliar topics .
<|Pparse|>
You tend to crank up the aggression in your images , be it to the point where the subjects of your work are on the verge of fissures opening up . It is necessary for you to be brash and rude while also starting to recognize your own presence in the field of street arts .

Be a consumer of materiality , cultivate pragmatic aesthetics , employ physical materials , situate yourself in suburban landscapes , modern zen gardens , and the alike .

Weekly early morning meetings and in-studio work are not for you . You prefer to work from home . Your local environment plays an important role here - calm , clear air is very important! A home with lots of doors means open and through paths of relatable communications , which is most conducive to create shared experiences .
<|Pparse|>
Incorporate recent developments into your practice , and be sure to incorporate the latest technological advancements . 
<br>Include recent travel and get off to the latest low-key attraction .
<br>This period is best for learning and teaching , and application for learning and teaching . 
<br>This is a great time to describe your speculative procrastination and criticize your composed daydream .
<br>Try not to start a diet , fast , or get into cleansing of any kind during this period .

Think how you will be able to present yourself with your artistic lifestyle . Perhaps you feel that you are being asked to grow and change the world in a personal and perhaps even controversial way . Perhaps you feel that you are being forced into a certain path or into some role you do not want to be in . You don't want to be a <em>“woe is me”</em> kind of person who is constantly complaining <em>“woe is me!”</em>
<|Pparse|>
At this time , you need to make sure to think about what you are <em>not</em> going to do .
<br>It is now an opportune time to make paintings .

The time has come to discuss your professional self . If you were to explain your role in any application , statement , or interview , it would be verging on useless chatter . Your ideal delivery device would be style , precision and description . Any unwanted or superfluous words will be fiercely cut off . Any existing values will be vigorously guarded .

Install your artwork in your bedroom as soon as you get home .

You may want to up your art game with your most recent works as the catalyst by virtue of your popularity .

If you’ve paused your practice for a while , then you need to make an art project for your ex , who is currently unemployed . This time , do not shy away from naming the project . And this time , do not worry about your budget or how to make ends meet . Although , it is better to postpone any large purchases , including a house or a car , as things are just looking up now .
<|Pparse|>
As for your wardrobe , this is the best time to pick out your headwear , as it will help you to blend in with the right crowd . For your skin , this is the best time to look for products with high <em>SPF</em> .

You may want to consider regularly posting on a blog , and get your work published there .
<|Pparse|>
Try to visit an art fair early in the morning during the first week in June . Visit an exhibition with half of the people you met before , while leaving behind an impressionistic , impressionistic memory .
<|Pparse|>
Make judgments of your artistic value . You’re based on whether someone is into your art or not , or based on your own aesthetic tastes--one or the other but not in-between . You are also on the list of people who are noticed for subtlety of their artworks rather than brilliance .
<|Pparse|>
Look for real sense in your rhetoric . When speaking and writing , you tend to fill in artificial words unavoidably , do so with bright , flowing prose . At the same time , do not hide yourself in long sentences .
<|Pparse|>
You might have a tough time analyzing your role in the <em>Art World</em> between right and wrong , truth and fiction . It might be hard to decide which is more important between now and then : the risks and resources you take right now or the doubts and debts you will have in the future .
<|Pparse|>
It is possible that you have been slow to respond to certain events or people because you are usually doing other chores for your job when organizing your ideas . 
<br>Apologize for any dry ideas you might be having .

Be online and be creative with your metaphors and images , and remember that <em>double adverbial</em> words you tend to use in your show applications do not have extra meaning even though they might appear redundantly decorated .

You are artistically ambidextrous .
<br>You are currently in the middle of a detailed design concept , or conceptual installation . Therefore , it is crucial to find an assistant or company that understands your work and would make your concept a reality .
<|Pparse|>
Right now , it's better to focus on your colleagues , and you will be able to demonstrate your strong relationships with other practitioners . You’re currently optimized at working with people , so long as you are able to find them in real life .
<|Pparse|>
You certainly don't have to put up with a constantly-running barrage of wacky conversation starters . 
<br>You may engage in lo-fi , low-grade-feverish affairs with fuzzy subject matter . 
<br>You’re quite capable of being otherworldly , and meanwhile stay aware that “mysteries” belong to the space you are in . A few frequencies to kickstart your thoughts : <em>feminism</em> , <em>avant-garde</em> , <em>biennials</em> , <em>post-AI</em> , <em>RGBA</em> , <em>LGBTQIAPK</em> .
<br>Become a celebrity and then become an artist .
<|Pparse|>
You don't like to feel under represented or underappreciated , and you come across as self-absorbed . Your flexibility in time and space of daily works and project tasks make it easy for you to become absorbed in a subject matter you will for sure overwork on . 
<|Pparse|>
You absorb plenty of the cosmic rays with your skin , thus maximizing its effectiveness in your mind when brainstorming . You are also most efficient at transporting heavy objects and automated materials around . Therefore , it makes sense to focus on physical things like architecture , machinery , and life-size sculpture .
<|Pparse|>
A tight deadline might make your train of thought smoother all week long . Long-distance calls and meetings are also likely to take a hit , as long as you’re able to retrieve others’ scheduled time zone . Their time zones aren't necessarily synchronous with the time you are currently in , but you are linked with nuanced networks . Your goals are a little bit here and there , but as time goes on , you will slowly but surely be able to pull apart the fragmented pieces . Though , you might not be able to reassemble them into a coherent whole .
<|Pparse|>
Generally speaking , no special knowledge or training is required for your self-promotion , except for some specialized knowledge in subjects like : Information Technology . 
<br>If your work is overly accessible or interactive , you’ll need to make sure people see it as art .
<|TheNextSign|>
Make your complaint into your artwork , the longer it is the more likely that you will succeed : make it as a vernacular or expansive poetry . Be familiar with alienated words describing art . You can complain about the way you are known to behave , or the way you are perceived by others . You can also complain that you are too attached to go through indefinite iterations of your artwork , or that you are too neurotic to be friends with others .
<|Pparse|>
You might be offered a research project or a job , depending on your expressed feelings on social media . However , absolutely don't count on it . If you are looking for the place of your next exhibition , you should submit your work directly to your favorite institution’s biennial . If you are in the business of selling art , you should apply your branding to your projects .
<|Pparse|>
You are very perceptive and particularly sensitive to criticisms and feel very vulnerable without even trying . Your judgment is good yet too quick . Learning to depend on others more will become more necessary for you , since you tend to exploit yourself too much and rely too little on others .

An important opportunity will be missed during a shift or a trip , so do not move or travel!

Fiery , flashy and entertaining decoration may melt away your favorite pattern in your favorite artwork of your own---stripping away all layers of meaning with a little creativity .
Sparkles would be a great addition to your most recent installation , together with your energetic and never-say-die style of functioning .
<|Pparse|>
You have been accepted into the art world and are currently living the “<em>high life</em>” .
<br>At the same time , don't feel bad if you have been working for several years without major achievement . Your condition is usually good and you are quite capable of supporting yourself financially . On the other hand , at some point you may even feel that you are not good enough , or that you deserve to be better . Either way , it is important that you work to re-evaluate the meaning of your existence .
<|Pparse|>
Your artwork is a hidden complaint with plans for the future . More often than not , this manifests in a more overt and perhaps even disruptive manner in your long-term career .

Situate your practice in the space between your awareness and the background noise of everyday life .

Your art will be most successful as a rip-off , an imposter , or a recontextualization , where formality is more important than reality . Your art is probably not going to change that , but it does offer a nice change of pace .
<br>Delusional . Rubbish . Your forced ideas tend to be your own worst enemy .

If you’re currently working on your reflections , consider dropping in on open meetings , sending in your reflections , critique guide , game theory , and anything relating to anonymity . Present the discussion results with potential employers / institutions .

You are the kind of artist who projects your self-image onto the viewer .
<|Pparse|>
As for your practice , you find yourself in an endless stream of <em>Requests , Candidacy , Commissions , Approaches , Collaborations ,</em> and <em>Marriages</em> of all above . Since you are to get back into the groove , it will be increasingly important to enjoy these occasions as much as possible . 
<|Pparse|>
The topic of legacy is very important to you . Your idea of what constitutes your legacy is how you expect others to perceive your role and responsibility . Thus , it is important that your art fails on your terms , and not on someone else's . If your art is to be accepted as authentic , then it <em>must fail</em> .

You’re in the battle known as the battle of the visual images . In this case , your practice will be easily portrayed as your self-image and defined through the senses than through the intellect . The self-image is central to your theory .

Your artistic expression will be better understood through a commission basis or trade . In terms of your artistic merit , a 7+ ranking in the social ladder is usually enough to get by with . With a 7th or 8th ranking in the social ladder , artistic merit ceases to be a factor and people's contributions become more important . However , for those at the bottom , this may not be enough .

Compulsive , pre-meditative , and then self-improvement . This is the process currently associated with your artistic position . 
<br>You are forever attuned to the universal wave of consciousness . Your career is anchored in the indivisibility of humanity .

During this time , it may be hard to justify your spending habits . Therefore , it is important to prioritize short-term projects and applications at hand .

You are forever attuned to the universal language of artsy articles , with an incredible talent for bringing people together . This aspect brings a certain charisma and you might be inclined to become involved with causes that promote social justice and tolerance .

You may be shy and prefer to gather the courage to go through the steps needed to actually make changes in the world .
<br>So get busy working on that perfect presentation you've been dreaming about! 
<br>Stay away from any books that promote radical ideas .

If you are working as an emerging artist , of course you need to be diligent in your search for a job . If you are unsure what kind of role or position suits you , start off browsing through various online communities . However artist communities can be a little too serious or zealous for your opinions , and maybe a little too cool for your words .

It's also important to take time to understand other's' needs and this can be achieved through discussions and emails .

Art school is certainly not for you . 
<br>Try street art or disciplines other than academic art .
<br>It will be much more enjoyable for you to work with highly visual people . 
<br>Any previous art projects will be refocused towards the new administration .

It's surprisingly easier to analyze problems and come up with solutions when you are tired and your mind is muddled up . You might come up with solutions that are overly detailed and laborious , since you have a tendency anyway toward excess and over-extravagance . Remember that your goal is to become more efficient , so don't sweat the small stuff .

Your art tastes eccentric , nonconformist but not weird . You may have a particular affinity for unusual or alternative forms of expression in your practice . Therefore , you may have trouble naming your projects , because your projects seem to contradict one another . 
Anyways , try to name it in plain words .

You may find your expressions dry . Like a cyberneticist’s story , it stirs up our logic that we can't tell . In this case you may find it helpful to absorb more vivid and more saturated colors into your vision over time . You will begin to take more notes during the day and perhaps even record and track your own ideas on your phone .

Right now it is not the time to attend critiques or write about works done by other artists around you . You might be able to learn from the process , but you are probably already too tired responding to other people’s work and grand plans .

<br>You may lack the sensation of being , or feeling , connected with , and accepted by , others through mental activities .

Art history is one of the most important influences of your art , since it’s concerned with the transmission of cultures - that is about as much as it does about transmission itself . However , things are getting repetitive and even get to be “zombie” art . Here's your chance to make some waves : imagine a scene! What if you transformed your “backyard” space into a multimedia experience ? What if you transformed your very specific aesthetics into a platform for collective artmaking ?

From conception to completion . Your primary medium is still to be determined - in other words , speculative and open-ended as well as verbal . Depending on the project , you might want to jump into pre-production as soon as possible .
<br>Some suggestions for styles and forms : a light show , a group photo , a private audience , performance art .

You are also very attuned to the vibrations in your environment so you are able to offer assistance at every turn . As for now , meditation is helpful for clearing the air , sharing your feelings , refining your outlook and answering questions . It also seems that you will find a monologue-like yet cunningly interactive style works best for your artworks .
<|Pparse|>
You don't like borders or boundaries between your pieces and the viewers , so you go out of your way to make your art as unobtrusive as possible .
<br>You don't like having to answer questions , so you preemptively ask them on your own initiative .
<br>Remember that the audience of your work are not always objectively sweet , but that does not mean they are not sweet .

You are fluid and amorphous , meaning you come and go from different times and contexts .
<br>Or just random bursts of creativity .
<|Pparse|>
You refer to yourself continuously . You are loyal to your role as an artist at a great degree .
<br>You refer to yourself constantly . It’s like you’re living through your own words . Use this to make your art and career more personal to you . Meanwhile be careful with the language , it can alienate you yourself fairly quickly .
<|Pparse|>
If an opportunity does not come your way , you will not accept it with faith .
<br>At this time , any attempt to reform or change your artmaking process is likely to fail . Instead , you revert to your former concept---feeling misunderstood and try to provide the best possible explanation for every phenomenon .
